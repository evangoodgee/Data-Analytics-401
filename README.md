The data files are too large to be pushed to GitHub, so I have included a link 
to a Google Drive folder that includes all data used.

All data is also publiclyavailable on the College Scorecard and IPEDS websites. 
College Scorecard allows you to download the data directly, while IPEDS utilizes 
a Microsoft Access database format. Both links are included below.
